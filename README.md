## Abstract

The coalescences of massive black hole binaries are one of the main targets of space-based gravitational wave observatories. Such gravitational wave sources are expected to be accompanied by electromagnetic emission. Low latency gravitational wave searches and accurate sky localization are key to successful follow-up observations of electromagnetic counterpart radiation. Here, we present a deep learning method for the first time to rapidly search for signals of massive black hole binaries in gravitational wave data. Our model is capable of processing 1-year of data, simulated from the LISA data challenge, in several seconds only, while identifying all coalescences of massive black hole binaries with no false alarms. We further demonstrate that the model shows robust resistance to a wide range of generalization cases, including various waveform families and updated instrumental configurations. This method is supposed to be an effective approach, which combined the advances of artificial intelligence to open a new pathway for space-based gravitational wave observations.
